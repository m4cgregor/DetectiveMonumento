# PLACEHOLDER - Target Image Required

This is a placeholder file. You need to replace this with an actual photo of the monument detail.

## Instructions:

1. Take a high-quality photo of the **Urna (eternal flame)** at the monument
2. Ensure the image has:
   - High resolution (at least 480x640 pixels)
   - Good contrast and clear details
   - Even lighting (no shadows or glare)
   - Sharp focus

3. Save the photo as `target-urna.png` or `target-urna.jpg`
4. Replace this file with your photo
5. Use the MindAR compiler to create `targets.mind`

See `AR_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.
