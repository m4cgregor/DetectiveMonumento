# PLACEHOLDER - Compiled Target File Required

This file should be generated using the MindAR Image Target Compiler.

## How to Create This File:

### Option 1: Online Compiler (Easiest)

1. Go to: https://hiukim.github.io/mind-ar-js-doc/tools/compile

2. Upload your 4 target images **in this exact order**:
   - target-friso.png (becomes targetIndex 0)
   - target-pampa.png (becomes targetIndex 1)
   - target-urna.png (becomes targetIndex 2)
   - target-torre.png (becomes targetIndex 3)

3. Click "Start" and wait for compilation

4. Download the generated file as `targets.mind`

5. Replace this placeholder file with the downloaded `targets.mind`

### Option 2: Command Line

```bash
# Install the compiler
npm install -g mind-ar-cli

# Compile your images
mind-ar-compiler \
  assets/target-friso.png \
  assets/target-pampa.png \
  assets/target-urna.png \
  assets/target-torre.png \
  assets/targets
```

This will create `assets/targets.mind`.

## Important Notes:

- ⚠️ **Order matters!** The first image becomes targetIndex 0, etc.
- ✅ Use high-quality images (300+ DPI, good contrast)
- ✅ Images should have clear, distinctive features
- ✅ Avoid blurry, low-contrast, or plain images

## Need Help?

See `AR_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions and troubleshooting.

## Verification:

Once you have `targets.mind`:
1. It should be a binary file (not text)
2. File size typically 100KB - 2MB depending on image complexity
3. The AR game will load it automatically

**The game will NOT work without this file!**
